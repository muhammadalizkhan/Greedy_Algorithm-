# Greedy_Algorithm
A greedy algorithm is a simple, intuitive approach to solving optimization problems. It makes locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. In other words, at each step, a greedy algorithm selects the best available option without considering the overall effect on the final solution.
